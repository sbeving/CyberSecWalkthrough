# 😎 Welcome to CySec Notes

#### by **Saleh Eddine Touil** — _a.k.a. Sbeve_

> ⚡ _“Hack everything, learn something.”_\
> This GitBook is my personal knowledge vault — a fusion of **CTF walkthroughs, Hack The Box machine writeups, offensive security notes, exploit development theory, and defensive insight.**\
> It’s not just a notes repo — it’s a **battle log** from the frontlines of cybersecurity training.

***

### 🚀 **Getting Started**

These are all my notes about **Cyber Security**, built from years of learning, breaking, fixing, and exploring digital systems.\
You’ll find everything from **enumeration and privilege escalation** to **reverse engineering, malware analysis, and red/blue team tactics** — written for hackers, by a hacker.

If you love digging deep, automating attacks, and understanding _why_ exploits work — you’ll feel right at home here. 🐚

| **Cheat Sheets**                     | Fast-access references for commands, payloads, and attack chains.                                    |
| **CTF Walkthroughs**                 | Step-by-step solutions for Capture The Flag challenges (Web, Pwn, Crypto, Forensics, OSINT, etc.)    |
| **Hack The Box Machines (TODO)**     | Full writeups (Easy → Insane) with enum, exploit, post-exploitation, and privilege escalation paths. |
| **Guides & Notes**                   | Practical notes on Linux, Windows, scripting, networking, and exploit development.                   |
| **Red & Blue Team Playbooks (TODO)** | Offensive and defensive operations, mapped and mirrored.                                             |

> 🧠 _Every note is battle-tested._\
> Everything you see here has been used, debugged, and refined through actual labs, HTB boxes, CTFs, and simulations.

### 🧠 **Highlights**

* 🧰 **Tools & Exploits:** curated guides on Metasploit, nmap, Aircrack-ng, Burp Suite, Empire, and more.
* 💻 **Scripting for Hackers:** Bash, Python, PowerShell, Go, and JavaScript — focused on automation & exploitation.
* 🔍 **Reverse Engineering & Binary Exploits:** from disassembly to shellcode.
* 🧱 **Hardening & Defense:** because offense without defense is just chaos.
* ⚔️ **Red vs. Blue Alignment:** MITRE-based detection mapping for every offensive technique.

### 🕶️ **Philosophy**

> _“Learn. Hack. Repeat.”_

This isn’t a “read-only” space — it’s a **lab in motion**.\
Every page reflects real commands, scripts, and field tactics.\
The goal: help you build both **offensive mastery** and **defensive awareness**.
