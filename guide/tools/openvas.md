# OpenVAS

## The OpenVAS Masterclass: Professional Vulnerability Assessment & Remediation

OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment Scanner) is a powerful open-source vulnerability scanner used by penetration testers and security analysts for network, server, and web application assessment. It features deep authenticated/unauthenticated scans, custom policies, reporting, and integration with enterprise workflows.

***

### I. Environment Setup: Dynamic Variables

Prepare repeatable, organized scanning sessions:

```bash
export TARGETS="targets.txt"               # List of hosts/IPs/networks
export SCAN_TASK="HTB Internal Audit"
export SCAN_CONFIG="Full and fast"         # Common configs: "Full and fast", "Full and very deep", "Web application scan", custom
export OUTPUT_DIR="openvas-results"
export REPORT_FILE="$OUTPUT_DIR/scan_report.html"
export CREDENTIALS_TYPE="SSH"
export CREDENTIALS_USER="vagrant"
export CREDENTIALS_PASS="vagrant"
export SCHEDULE="Weekly Audit"

```

***

### II. Core Capabilities & Workflow

* **Comprehensive Vulnerability Coverage:** Scans servers, endpoints, web apps, devices for tens of thousands of CVEs and misconfigurations using regularly updated Network Vulnerability Tests (NVTs)\[1]\[2]\[3].
* **Authenticated & Unauthenticated Scans:** Deep assessments of internal software, patch status, configuration, leveraging credentials for OS-level review. Unauthenticated for attacker’s view\[1]\[3].
* **Custom & Compliance Policies:** Configure scan policies/templates for targeted, full, web, compliance (PCI, ISO, CIS, HIPAA, custom)\[1]\[3].
* **Extensible Plugin Architecture:** Massive, open plugin library (NVTs), supported by daily community and commercial updates\[3]\[2].
* **Reporting & Risk Prioritization:** CVSS-based severity, exploitability, asset groups, actionable remediation advice, and trend analytics\[3]\[2].
* **Automation:** Recurring scan scheduling, API integrations, export/reporting for SOC, SIEM, or ticketing\[3]\[1].

***

### III. Professional Usage Workflow & Examples

#### 1. Configure & Launch Scan

* Use Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA) web UI or Greenbone Vulnerability Manager (GVMd) API.
* Set scan config: e.g., “Full and fast”, “Web app scan”.
* Import `targets.txt` for bulk scanning.

#### 2. Credentialed (Authenticated) Scanning

* Add credentials: SSH for Linux/Unix; SMB/RDP for Windows.
* Scan config detects hidden vulns, weak permissions, default creds, patch gaps.

#### 3. Performance/Tuning

* Throttle scan speed for fragile devices, use asset filters, tune NVTs, plugins, limit network range.
* Parallel/distributed scanning if available.

#### 4. Recurring, Automated Assessments

* Schedule daily/weekly scans (`SCHEDULE`) or event-driven.
* Enable automatic NVT feed updates.

#### 5. Review & Analyze Results

* Critical/high vulns, grouped by CVSS, asset, exploitability.
* Export in HTML, PDF, XML, CSV for reporting/remediation\[1]\[3].

#### 6. Remediation & Integration

* Push findings/tickets directly to ITSM or SIEM.
* Map remediation steps directly from OpenVAS report.
* Trend reporting, asset tracking for compliance.

***

### IV. Advanced Techniques & Scenarios

* **Targeted App/Host Scanning:** Scan select services (SSH, SMB, web only); use custom asset groups.
* **Custom Policy/Plugin Management:** Develop custom NVTs for specialized needs or non-standard protocols.
* **Compliance & Hardening Benchmarks:** Upload or build audit files for internal/industry policies (PCI, CIS, ISO).
* **API Integration:** Initiate, manage, and export scans from CI/CD, SOC, vulnerability management platforms via RESTful API\[3].
* **Trend Analysis & Change Tracking:** Compare scans over time, measure remediation and new risk exposure.

***

### V. Real-World Workflow Example

1.  **Prepare Targets and Credentials**

    ```bash
    export TARGETS="hosts_internal.txt"
    export CREDENTIALS_USER="admin"
    export CREDENTIALS_PASS="strongpass"

    ```
2. **Create Scheduled Scan**
   * “Full and fast” config for weekly audits.
3. **Run Credentialed Scan**
   * Detect patch gaps, privilege issues, local flaws.
4. **Review & Export Findings**
   * Export HTML/PDF report for IT, patch management.
5. **Remediation and Validation**
   * Push tickets, document fixes, run repeat scan to verify.

***

### VI. Pro Tips & Best Practices

* **Regularly update NVTs** for the latest vulnerability coverage\[2]\[3].
* **Always perform credentialed scans** for deeper, actionable results (where possible)\[2].
* **Tune scan configs** for fragile or mission-critical assets.
* **Prioritize remediation** based on CVSS severity and exploitability.
* **Integrate with SIEM, ticketing, and asset management** for efficient tracking and compliance.
* **Automate scans** for ongoing security posture and rapid response to emerging threats.
* **Document configurations, policies, and remediation steps** for audit/compliance.
