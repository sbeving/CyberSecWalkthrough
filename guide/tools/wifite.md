## The Wifite Masterclass: Professional Wireless Penetration Testing & Automation

Wifite is an advanced automated tool for auditing and attacking Wi-Fi networks, streamlining end-to-end wireless penetration testing. It integrates with Aircrack-ng, Reaver, Bully, and more, enabling ethical hackers and red teamers to efficiently uncover and exploit weaknesses in WEP, WPA/WPA2, and WPS-enabled networks.

***

### I. Environment Setup: Dynamic Variables

Organize campaign settings for scalable, repeatable workflow:

```bash
export INTERFACE="wlan0"               # Wireless interface in monitor mode (e.g., mon0, wlan0mon)
export OUTPUT_DIR="wifite-results"
export WORDLIST="/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt"
export BSSID="AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"       # Target specific AP, optional
export CHANNEL=6                       # Channel, optional
export ATTACK_MODE="wpa"               # "wpa", "wep", "wps"
export THREADS=4

```

***

### II. Core Capabilities & Workflow

* **Automated Network Discovery:** Scans and lists all Wi-Fi networks in range, identifying security protocol, signal strength, and channel automatically.\[1]\[2]\[3]\[4]
* **Multi-Protocol Attack Support:** Seamlessly attacks WEP, WPA/WPA2-PSK, and WPS networks using optimized, adaptive strategies.\[2]\[3]\[4]\[1]
  * **WEP:** Captures IVs, automates injection, ARP replay, fragmentation, or chop-chop attacks for rapid key discovery.
  * **WPA/WPA2:** Captures 4-way handshakes and attempts offline password cracking (integrating Aircrack-ng, Cowpatty, or specified wordlists).\[3]\[4]\[1]
  * **WPS:** Uses Reaver/Bully for online, offline, and Pixie-Dust PIN attacks to recover keys.
* **Target Selection:** Manual or automatic targeting of the best candidates based on vulnerability, signal strength, or user input.\[1]\[3]
* **Customizable & Adaptive Attacks:** Supports targeted attacks (`-bssid`, `-channel`, custom wordlists, brute force or dictionary approaches), intelligent fallback between attack methods.\[3]\[1]
* **Live Monitoring & Reporting:** Visual, color-coded, ongoing status updates and result display; logs all recovered handshakes and keys.\[1]\[3]
* **Integration & Compatibility:** Bundles and drives tools like Aircrack-ng, Reaver, Cowpatty, Bully, and Tshark for broad protocol support.\[4]\[3]\[1]

### III. Professional Usage Examples

#### 1. Automatic Scan and Attack (Full Auditing)

```bash
sudo wifite --interface $INTERFACE
# Launches scan, presents targets; proceed to option selection or auto-attack

```

#### 2. Target Specific AP (with BSSID and Channel)

```bash
sudo wifite --interface $INTERFACE --bssid $BSSID --channel $CHANNEL

```

#### 3. WPA/2 Attack with Custom Wordlist

```bash
sudo wifite --interface $INTERFACE --wpa --dict $WORDLIST

```

#### 4. WPS-Only Attack

```bash
sudo wifite --interface $INTERFACE --wps

```

#### 5. Save Output to Directory

```bash
sudo wifite --interface $INTERFACE --save $OUTPUT_DIR

```

### IV. Advanced Techniques & Scenarios

* **Evil Twin Support:** Combine with external tools or scripts post-handshake capture for Evil Twin and captive portal attacks.\[1]
* **Custom Dict/Fuzzing:** Use enhanced wordlists for challenging WPA2 or forced brute-forcing difficult handshakes.\[2]\[3]
* **Parallel Multi-Network Attacks:** Simultaneously audit multiple targets using threads or session management.\[4]
* **Passive Recon:** Use in scan-only/monitoring mode for OSINT or network profiling.\[2]\[4]\[1]
* **Log and Export:** Archive all handshakes, session data, and recovered passwords for post-assessment reporting.\[3]\[1]
* **Red Team Integration:** Wifite can be scripted for automated assessments as part of red team/enterprise Wi-Fi attack frameworks.\[3]
* **Hybrid Attacks with Other Tools:** Launch Wireshark or Kismet for in-depth capture/monitoring during/after Wifite assessment.\[5]\[1]
* **Handle 2.4GHz & 5GHz Bands:** Ensure interface/driver supports dual band for maximum coverage.

### V. Real-World Workflow Example

1. **General Automatic Audit**

```bash
wifite --interface wlan0

```

1. **Focused WPA Crack (with Dict) on Corporate AP**

```bash
wifite --interface wlan0mon --bssid AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF --channel 36 --wpa --dict rockyou.txt

```

1. **Evil Twin and Session Harvest (Advanced)**

* Capture handshake, disengage, and then trigger captive portal phishing for credentials as second stage (manual/scripted).

***

### VI. Pro Tips & Best Practices

* Use high-performance/dedicated Wi-Fi adapters supporting monitor mode and injection.
* Always synchronize time for reliable handshake capture.
* Validate all recovered hashes/handshakes with Aircrack-ng before reporting.
* Regularly update supporting tools (Reaver, Bully, Aircrack-ng).
* Only audit networks owned by or permitted for penetration testingâ€”follow all legal/ethical standards.\[6]\[4]\[3]
* Export all findings for client documentation and incident response.
