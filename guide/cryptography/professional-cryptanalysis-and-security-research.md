# Professional Cryptanalysis & Security Research

> _‚ÄúReal cryptanalysis is about proof, not theft.‚Äù_\
> Learn how professional researchers evaluate ciphers, design experiments, and responsibly disclose weaknesses.

***

### I. üéì Professional Scope & Ethics

* **Goal:** discover mathematical or implementation weaknesses ‚Üí report ‚Üí help patch.
* **Boundaries:** only analyze data or systems you own, or that explicitly allow testing (CTFs, bug-bounty labs).
* **Output:** white-paper, PoC in sandbox, responsible disclosure to vendor or CVE.

### III. üî¨ Algorithm Evaluation Workflow

1. **Specification Review** ‚Äì read cipher specs (FIPS 197 for AES, RFCs for HMAC etc.).
2. **Implementation Audit** ‚Äì check padding, mode, key management.
3. **Test Vectors** ‚Äì verify known-good inputs produce expected outputs.
4. **Differential Testing** ‚Äì mutate inputs to see avalanche effect behavior.
5. **Statistical Tests** ‚Äì run frequency, runs, correlation tests.
6. **Fault Simulation** ‚Äì use emulated bit-flips to study error propagation.

| **Linear Cryptanalysis**       | Block ciphers            | Approximate cipher as linear equations           |
| **Algebraic Attack**           | Stream / block ciphers   | Model as polynomial system solving               |
| **Timing / Power Analysis**    | Hardware crypto          | Measure execution time or power use              |
| **Lattice / Coppersmith**      | RSA                      | Solve partial information problems mod n         |
| **Meet-in-the-Middle**         | Double encryption (3DES) | Trade time for memory                            |
| **Boomerang / Integral**       | AES-like                 | Advanced differential variants                   |
| **Fault Injection**            | Smart cards / chips      | Induce computation errors                        |

Each is studied in controlled academic labs with toy key sizes and public datasets.

### VI. üß† How to Research Ciphers Professionally

1. **Build Toy Models** ‚Äì reduce rounds (2-4 of AES).
2. **Automate Differential Search** ‚Äì script input pairs ‚Üí collect output bias.
3. **Prove Bias** ‚Äì use œá¬≤ tests or correlation coefficients.
4. **Document Findings** ‚Äì graphs, equations, probabilities.
5. **Responsible Disclosure** ‚Äì contact maintainers or publish through IACR ePrint if novel.

### VII. üìà Entropy & Randomness Analysis

* Uniform distribution test ‚Üí frequency of bits.
* Runs test ‚Üí number of bit switches.
* Spectral test ‚Üí periodicity.\
  Use `dieharder -a -f cipher.bin` for lab experiments.

### VIII. üîè Key-Management and Implementation Pitfalls

* Predictable RNG (seed = time) ‚Üí deterministic keys.
* Static IV or nonce reuse.
* Improper padding (PKCS#7 without check).
* Partial hash comparison (`strncmp(digest, input, 8)` ).\
  Professionals model these in testbeds to teach secure coding.
