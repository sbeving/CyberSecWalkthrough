## CPTS Preparation Guide 2025

The Hack The Box Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (HTB CPTS) is a highly practical, hands-on certification designed to validate intermediate-level penetration testing skills in real-world scenarios. Unlike other certifications, HTB CPTS emphasizes enterprise-like environments, requiring candidates to complete the Penetration Tester job-role path on HTB Academy, including the Owen module, and pass a challenging 10-day exam. This guide provides a beginner-friendly, step-by-step roadmap to prepare for the HTB CPTS exam, incorporating the Owen module and other HTB Academy resources, along with a comprehensive list of tools and resources to ensure success. Whether you’re new to cybersecurity or have some experience, this guide will help you build the skills and confidence needed to earn the HTB CPTS certification. Let’s get started!

### Understanding the HTB CPTS Exam

The HTB CPTS exam is a 10-day, hands-on penetration testing challenge where candidates must compromise a real-world, enterprise-like network, capture a minimum number of flags (e.g., 12/14 user and root flags), and submit a commercial-grade report. The exam environment, accessible via VPN or HTB’s Pwnbox, simulates a black-box penetration test with web applications, network services, and Active Directory (AD) components. Key features include:

* **Focus Areas**: Web application security, network exploitation, Active Directory attacks, privilege escalation, and vulnerability chaining.
* **Practical Nature**: No multiple-choice questions; candidates must perform actual pentesting tasks and document findings.
* **Report Requirement**: A detailed, professional report is mandatory, including methodology, vulnerabilities, attack chains, and remediation advice.
* **Difficulty**: Labeled as intermediate but considered challenging, even for experienced pentesters, due to its emphasis on creative vulnerability chaining and real-world scenarios. X posts highlight its difficulty, with some comparing it to OSCP but noting its longer duration and enterprise focus.

**Exam Prerequisites**: Candidates must complete 100% of the **Penetration Tester job-role path** (28 modules, 1980 Cubes) on HTB Academy, including the Owen module, before purchasing an exam voucher (\~$210 USD).

**Sentiment on X**: Recent posts praise HTB CPTS for its affordability, practical focus, and relevance to modern pentesting, especially AD exploitation. Some users report it as more challenging than OSCP or PNPT due to its complexity and report requirements.

For beginners, expect 3–6 months of preparation, depending on prior experience.

### Prerequisites for HTB CPTS Preparation

Before starting HTB CPTS prep, ensure you have the following foundational knowledge:

* **Basic Networking**: Understand TCP/IP, OSI model, common ports (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 445 for SMB), and protocols. CompTIA Network+ is a good starting point.
* **Linux Basics**: Familiarity with Linux commands (ls, cd, grep, etc.) and navigation. OverTheWire Bandit is ideal for beginners.
* **Basic Security Concepts**: Knowledge of vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) and security principles (e.g., CompTIA Security+ level).
* **Scripting Basics**: Basic Python or Bash scripting for automation or exploit modification.
* **Time Commitment**: Dedicate 10–20 hours per week for 3–6 months.

If you’re a complete beginner, the resources and steps below will guide you through building these skills.
